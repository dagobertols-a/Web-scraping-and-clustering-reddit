One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. However, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an **educational divide**.

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. A nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety. It is later implied that she would have died from this contact if not for the fetus ""absorbing"" the radiation and dying immediately after birth.

**Is actual radiation contamination *that* contagious?** [This article](https://www.livescience.com/13444-radiation-exposure-contagious.html) seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies.

,How do we know what Ancient Egyptian (or any ancient language) sounded like? How accurate are names like “Osiris” and “Tutankhamen” to what they actually sounded like when spoken by Ancient Egyptians?,13811,7trnof,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7trnof/how_do_we_know_what_ancient_egyptian_or_any/,1125,"Egyptian is just an example in this question, and this can apply to Ancient Mayan mythology, or pretty much any ancient religion/society 

This has always confused me. Where do our anglicanized names like these come from and how confident are we that this is what these historical and mythological figures were called by ancient peoples?

****

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point. 

Thanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. It totally answered my question and questions I didn't know I had. ",2018-01-29 14:21:56,,

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

The image reveals the black hole at the centre of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun

Are there (native or non-western) cultures that commonly fetishize body parts other than the western standard of vagina, penis, butt and breasts? If so, is clothing in any way related to this phenomenom?

AMA!,9580,4zdkra,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4zdkra/askscience_ama_series_we_have_discovered_an/,1060,"*Guests:* Pale Red Dot team, Julien Morin (Laboratoire Univers et Particules de Montpellier, Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, France), James Jenkins (Departamento de Astronomia, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile), Yiannis Tsapras (Zentrum fur Astronomie der Universitat Heidelberg (ZAH), Heidelberg, Germany).

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

Thank you in advance. 

Edit: Really interesting answers by everyone so far. Thank you! 

Edit 2: Follow up question. What are the biological implications when a species that we thought was extinct, rebounds it's population? Is it just limited to things like focusing on changing what caused their extinction in the first place, like eradicating the rats in the ""tree lobster"" article? 

Edit 3: Holy cow ladies and gents. I never thought I would get this much feedback on my post. It's going to take me a bit to read through it. But I will. In the mean time, thank you again, from the bottom of my heart, for all your answers and feedback. 

Edit 4: Here are a couple links that led me to believe that the sightings had increased and were credible enough to be taken seriously by scientists.  (copy/pasted from a buried comment) 
 Here is a different [news source](https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/tech/extinct-creature-sightings-piling-australia-130041464.html) which I read a couple days ago that prompted me to think that the number of sightings have increased recently. 

In the article they mention several recent sightings and the fact that there is a team of scientists taking action to further investigate the claims.

More information on the scientists conducting the research can be found [here](https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2017/march/fnq-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger) in a media release from James Cook University. Dr. Sandra Abell and professor Bill Laurence will be leading a team of scientists that will be placing 50 wildlife cameras out in strategic locations to try to catch a glimpse of the creature. This is part of an already existing study that they were conducting to monitor wildlife that had been modified to focus on the Tasmanian Tigers following the credible sighting reports.

Rational-Discourse,Prosthetics: Can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?,8810,9odirf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9odirf/prosthetics_can_someone_born_without_a_limb/,210,"I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

Any thoughts?

First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**To recap**

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

desichhokra,Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?,8098,bzar5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/bzar5g/is_there_any_record_of_any_object_from_earth/,1123,"I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. The Moon**

>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite – Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
>  
>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

Edit: Wow, the replies on here are really fantastic, thank you guys!

TIL: the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a [WWII German Ju87 Stuka Dive Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87). It was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

[Here's some archive footage](https://youtu.be/5uvqhA4_2tU) \- thank you u/BooleanRadley for the link and info

Turns out we associate the sound with any old-school dive-bombers because of Hollywood.

&#x200B;

I'm really impressed by most of your responses,but their is a question in my mind that is still bugging me.

When a person gets really old,cancer cells would form in a certain part of his body since his DNA becomes ""weaker""as he got older ,but let's say just in this case that the cancer cells can not move to other parts of his body(Metastasis )to make the situation similar to plants where cancer cells are locked in this position since they have cell walls that surround the cells. Cancer cells would still originate from different parts of his body as he gets older until tumor covers all of  him and he dies.

This case is theoretically possible for a human,but some trees live for thousands of years and it doesn't seem that tumors are covering all of their parts...Why?",2019-06-29 00:51:33,499,19532

**Edit:** So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

* Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.

I was outside for all of twenty minutes as tightly and hotly bundled as a human can be and my eyelashes froze and I thought I'd freeze solid if I had to stay outside for an hour. I could hardly see where I was going while I was walking into the wind I had to keep blinking and wiping the ice away.

All the while I saw dozen of birds out flying around, in the few patches of river that hadn't frozen yet and flying in the air above. It was -20 give or take when I went out, and that's peanuts compared to what it was overnight, but these birds clearly survived that. How do they manage it?

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

AMA!",7226,avqbib,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/avqbib/askscience_ama_series_im_matthias_hebrok_and_my/,244,"I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.


I'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!

But do the different hazards actually affect firefighting practice, or do firefighters have a generic approach anyway?

UPDATE 19 June: Wow. Thanks for awesome answers everyone. I'll attempt to do a brief summary:

* It's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. Water can still be used. A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

* It's a concern for removing and storing the wreck. Li-ion batteries can reignite after seemingly being extinguished and this can go on for days.

* Vehicle manufacturers provide fire departments with safety information, for example diagrams of where not to cut a vehicle.",2018-06-17 17:03:34,71942,19620

Are they late comers or early bloomers whose development cycle missed a year and caused them to miss the party, and so they pop up without anyone else around to mate with? Or is there a stable population of these cicadas each year that have drifted out of sync thousands of years ago - if so, will they diverge into a separate species after enough time?

I’m [Brian Hare](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/people/brian-hare), and I’m here to talk about canine cognition and how ordinary and extraordinary dog behaviors reveal the role of cognition in the rich mental lives of dogs. The scientific community has made huge strides in our understanding of dogs’ cognitive abilities – I’m excited to share some of the latest and most fascinating – and sometimes surprising – discoveries with you. Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?
 
A bit more about me: I’m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the [Duke Canine Cognition Center](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs), which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com), an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs. 
 
Let’s talk about the amazing things dogs can do and why – Ask Me Anything!
 
For background: Please learn more about me in [my bio here](https://www.dognition.com/brian-hare) or check me out in the new podcast series [DogSmarts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dogsmarts/id1115304038?mt=2) by Purina Pro Plan on iTunes and Google Play to learn more about dog cognition.
 
This AMA is being facilitated as part of a partnership between Dognition and Purina Pro Plan BRIGHT MIND, a breakthrough innovation for dogs that provides brain-supporting nutrition for cognitive health.

What would be the velocity of the bursting edge, as it propagates away from the initiation point?

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

For simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- Perfectly spherical
- Evenly distributed surface
- No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""Pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

It seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping.

Right now my work focuses on the foraging ecology of the *cutest* corvid, the Canda jay.  For the previous six years though, I studied the funeral behaviors of American crows. These studies involved trying to understand the adaptive motivations for why crows alarm call and gather near the bodies of deceased crows through both field techniques and non-lethal brain imaging techniques.  Along the way, I found some pretty surprising things out about how and when crows touch dead crows.  Let's just say sometimes they really put the crow in necrophilia!

Edit:
It also usually happens in the middle of typing. It never happened, for me, on first letters I typed. And, I am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. When it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. It is always unexpected.

Edit2:
I can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones I am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. A lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings. So, there is a small chance that i am imagining it.

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3mjrdt/nasa_to_confirm_active_briny_water_flows_on_mars/cvfq50q) got me wondering.

If you were in a decompression chamber and gradually decompressed (to avoid the bends), could you walk out onto the Martian surface with just an oxygen tank, provided that the surface was experiencing those balmy summer temperatures mentioned in the comment?

I read The Martian recently, and I was thinking this possibility could have changed the whole book.

It's 3/14/15, the Pi Day of the century! Grab a slice of your favorite Pi Day dessert and celebrate with us. 

**Our experts are here to answer your questions, and this year we have a treat that's *almost* sweeter than pi: we've teamed up with some experts from /r/AskHistorians to bring you the history of pi.** We'd like to extend a special thank you to these users for their contributions here today!

Here's some reading from /u/Jooseman to get us started:

> The symbol π was not known to have been introduced to represent the number until 1706, when Welsh Mathematician William Jones (a man who was also close friends with Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Edmund Halley) used it in his work *Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos* (or a *New Introduction to the Mathematics*.) There are several possible reasons that the symbol was chosen. The favourite theory is because it was the initial of the ancient Greek word for periphery (the circumference).

> Before this time the symbol π has also been used in various other mathematical concepts, including different concepts in Geometry, where William Oughtred (1574-1660) used it to represent the periphery itself, meaning it would vary with the diameter instead of representing a constant like it does today (Oughtred also introduced a lot of other notation). In Ancient Greece it represented the number 80.

> The story of its introduction does not end there though. It did not start to see widespread usage until Leonhard Euler began using it, and through his prominence and widespread correspondence with other European Mathematicians, it's use quickly spread. Euler originally used the symbol p, but switched beginning with his 1736 work *Mechanica* and finally it was his use of it in the widely read *Introductio* in 1748 that really helped it spread.

The system can reproduce many of the key quantum mechanical phenomena including single and double slit interference, tunneling, quantization, and multi-modal statistics. These experiments draw attention to pilot wave theories like those of de Broglie and Bohm that postulate the existence of a guiding wave accompanying every particle. It is an open question whether dynamics similar to those seen in the oil droplet experiments underly the statistical theory of quantum mechanics.

Derek (/u/Veritasium) will be around to answer questions, as well as Prof. John Bush (/u/ProfJohnBush), a fluid dynamicist from MIT.

Recently, I stumbled across the opposite scenario. I found a population of the most active supermassive black holes out there. These black holes are so active that we normally would not expect their host galaxies to be intact and forming lots of stars... and yet, they are! I coined this population ""cold quasars"" due to the amount of cold gas and dust they have.

My lab is building more efficient CRISPR-based gene editing tools to supercharge the human immune system to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity. AMA!",5529,9igycc,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9igycc/askscience_ama_series_im_alex_marson_and_im_an/,358,"Genetic engineering is now cheap, relatively simple, and pretty reliable - at least when done in a lab setting. Using a tool called CRISPR, researchers can access DNA in live cells, target specific strings of the DNA code to slice out, turn gene expression up or down, or even swap in new DNA. This means we can, theoretically, reverse genetic conditions, modify cell behaviors, and perhaps program the cells to better fight against disease.

If you want an overview on CRISPR and how it works, my university created this animated explainer: [https://youtu.be/iXgU--ugLqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXgU--ugLqY)

My lab is using CRISPR to better understand how the genome controls the functions of human immune cells, in health and disease. We hope to use this research to inform future cell-based therapies to fight cancer, infectious disease, and autoimmunity.

If you're deeply interested in CRISPR, you may have heard of our recent work - we discovered a way to make CRISPR more efficient and flexible in re-writing long DNA sequences in human immune cells, without the use of viruses. There are currently FDA approved gene engineered T cell therapies for certain types of cancer. These cells have been generated by using modified viruses to deliver genes into haphazard sites in the T cell genomes. Improved non-viral CRISPR delivery allows us, effectively, to paste long new stretches of DNA sequences into specific sites in the genome, without having to rely viruses that are costly and laborious to employ. We are working to develop non-viral CRISPR-based genome targeting into broadly useful platforms to make better, faster, cheaper engineered T cells for the next generation of immunotherapies.

You can read my university's story about it here: [http://tiny.ucsf.edu/OccPKL](http://tiny.ucsf.edu/OccPKL)

Andy: ""Well, it was radioactive and found in the ground before. Why not put it back when we are done with it?""

I am not sure wether this is the correct place to ask this question but here goes.
Does the force of gravity travel at the speed of light? 

I have read some articles that we haven't confirmed this experimentally.
If I understand this correctly newtonian gravity claims instant force..
So that's a no-go.
Now I wonder how accurate relativistic calculations are and how much room they allow for deviations.( 99%c for example)
Are we experiencing the gravity of the sun 499 seconds ago? 


Edit:

Sorry , i did not mean the force of gravity but the gravitational waves .

I am sorry if I upset some people asking this question, I am just trying to grasp the fundamental forces as we understand them.

nmhnmhnmhnmh,Does this* number have a name?,5192,5kthg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5kthg7/does_this_number_have_a_name/,357,"I would be more specific in the title, but it would be too incomprehensible and cut-short probably. It will take some explanation before I get to my question again but it's there:

I was working on a math puzzle a while back where I had to guess the next number in a series. The given series was ""1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, __"" and I had to guess the last number. I guessed correctly, but instead of intuitively realizing that the pattern was "" x^2 "", I found the answer via another method.

I found the differences between the adjacent numbers in the series, i.e. 4 - 1 = 3, 9 - 4 = 5, so on, and used those to create a new series: ""3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13"". I then performed the same operation on that line, finding the differences between adjacent numbers and then using those to create a new line: ""2, 2, 2, 2, 2"".

I thought this was interesting, because by performing this differences method twice on my given series, I was able to bottom-out/hit a ceiling at the number 2*. The number 2 was useful, because I could then work my way back down/up (depends on how you write it down, I guess) to find the next number in the series: 64.

I decided to try this again on a new, related series. I made the series ""1, 8, 27, 64, 125"" ( x^3 ) and resolved to use the same differences method on this line. The first time yields: 7, 19, 37, 61""; the second time yields: ""12, 18, 24""; the third time bottoms out at: ""6, 6"".

So ( x^2 ) bottoms out at 2*, and ( x^3 ) bottoms out at 6*.

I continued this with ( x^4 ): ""1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401"". The differences method yields: ""15, 65, 175, 369, 671, 1105""; again, and it yields: ""50, 110, 194, 302, 434""; again, and it yields: ""60, 84, 108, 132""; again, and it yields: ""24, 24, 24"".

So ( x^4 ) bottoms out at 24*.

Finally, my question: Is there a name for these bedrock numbers that I've marked with the asterisks? 

Additionally, I would like to know: is there reading material on the matter? Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?

tl;dr:

2 underlies ( x^2 ),
6 underlies ( x^3 ),
24 underlies ( x^4 ),
and so on, for reasons explained above.

Assuming that these 2 objects both have an atmosphere, would it be possible for these atmospheres to mingle?  Or would an orbit that close together be unstable (due to atmospheric drag perhaps?).

I'm writing a science fiction story where it may be possible to travel from the planet to the moon while remaining in atmosphere (albeit, a very thin atmosphere).

EDIT:

What about if I introduce a third body?  A planet, a moon with a very elliptic orbit and a second much further out moon.  The closer moon's elliptic orbit would usually carry it close to the planet at perigee, but not close enough for their atmospheres to touch/mingle.  But once every thousand orbits or so the second moon would influence the other's orbit enough to make it dip closer to the planet (lets say a couple of thousand KM of the planets surface, for argument's sake this is a large planet with a deep atmosphere), then on the next orbit it would ""straighten it back out again"".

Could this be stable?  Would tidal forces rip the moon apart?  Would the constant drag in those once-in-a-thousand close passes be enough to destabilize the moon's orbit and send it crashing into the planet (or slingshot it out to space)?

For the sake of the story this has to be a stable arrangement that has existed for untold millions of years.  Also the close passes would have to be within living memory (a couple of thousand years apart would work, maybe as far apart as 10,000 years).

As a side note, I suppose I'll have to write in that at perigee whether or not the atmospheres mingle the moon's gravitational influence would cause massive tides, increases in volcanism, and just general doomsday scenarios.

The oceans cover more than 70 percent of the planet and hold the key to many critical challenges facing science and society, from sustainably feeding human populations to addressing the impacts of climate change to protecting vulnerable marine species.

One of the cornerstone methods of keeping tabs on the oceans is through innovative tools and technologies to monitor them. At Scripps Oceanography we contribute to several ocean observation systems and networks that relay critical data about the seas and how they are changing. These include networks just off our populated coastlines (Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System, (http://www.sccoos.org/)) for applications as diverse as marine operations, coastal hazards, and ecosystems, to far out at sea where it's not easy to access information (Argo, (http://argo.ucsd.edu/)) to help us understand phenomena such as El Niños and ocean warming.

I look forward to answering your questions about ocean observations between 12 and 1 EST on Tuesday, 21 June! Ask Me Anything!

&#x200B;

Can someone please explain why I had a sturdy plastic bucket literally explode into fragments when I mixed 2 different brands of pool chlorine together? I've never seen something explode like that when exposed to open air.

So what I would normally do is mix the chlorine with pool water and then pour everything into the pool, no problem.

One day we switched chlorine brands, so I poured the last little bit of the original chlorine into the bucket (there might have been a little water in the bucket to begin with) and topped up with the new chlorine. I noticed vapor coming off the mixture almost immediately as I started mixing. The reaction started bubbling and boiling and within about 10 seconds, the mixture started putting out a thick yellow cloud. This was when I knew I had to GTFO, mainly to avoid breathing in any of the noxious fumes. I can't quite remember if I was going to call someone or to get water to dilute the mixture.

I turned around and started walking and as I turned a corner about 5 meters away from where the bucket was left standing, I heard an incredibly loud bang and saw pieces of the red bucket fly past me and land in the pool and on the lawn over 10 meters away. There was literally nothing left at ground zero other than a few white stains from the powder. It was a really powerful explosion.

&#x200B;

This happened quite some years ago when I used to look after the pool at home, so the details may be a bit sketchy. I've always thought about that incident, what if I hadn't moved away? I could have been permanently blinded, or developed some kind of respiratory issue, possibly even hearing damage?

&#x200B;

P.S. the brands were HTH and Clarity in that order (i think)

There was no outside contamination that I know of.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the replies and explanations so far. I'm glad I'm not the only one surprised/confused by this. Just a couple things, This *was* a long time ago like I said, so it might not have bubbled for 10 seconds, the gas might have been green instead of yellow, etc. All I know for sure is that it was loud, it started raining red plastic bits, there was definitely no lid on the bucket and that there were 2 brands of chlorine in a bucket.",2018-09-25 15:40:42,54340,23642

AUA!",4994,cl2ljr,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/cl2ljr/askscience_ama_series_we_are_bioengineers_from/,178,"Hi Reddit! We're the team of researchers behind the world's first fully synthetic protein ""switch"" that can control living cells. It's called LOCKR, and it's a general building block to create circuits in cells, similar to the electrical circuits that drive basically all modern electronics (Wired called this the ""biological equivalent of a PID algorithm"", for any ICS people out there).

Imagine this: A patient gets a traumatic head injury, causing swelling. Some inflammation is necessary for healing, but too much can cause brain damage. The typical approach today is to administer drugs to control the swelling, but there's no way to know the perfect dose and the drugs often cause inflammation to plummet so low that it impedes healing.

With LOCKR (stands for Latching Orthogonal Cage Key pRoteins), you could create ""smart"" cells programmed to sense inflammation and respond automatically to maintain a desired level - not too high, not too low, but enough to maximize healing without causing permanent damage. BTW, we've made the system freely available to all academics..

We're here to talk about protein design, genetic engineering and synthetic biology, from present efforts to future possibilities. We'll be on at 11 AM PT (2 PM ET, 18 UT). Ask us anything!

There was recently news article about a company that stored energy using big blocks of cement which they pulled up to store energy and let fall down to release it again. Lets consider this is a perfect system without any energy losses. 

How much would the energy needed and energy restored differ if we took into account position of them Moon? Ie if we pulled the load up when the Moon is right above us and it's gravity 'helps' with the pulling and vice versa when it's on the opposite side of Earth and helps (or atleast doesn't interfere) with the drop. 

I know the effect is probably immeasurable so how big the block would need to be (or what other variables would need to change) for a Moon to have any effect? Moon can move oceans afterall. ",2018-09-04 17:08:43,26472,7318

We are Dr. Mads Daugaard, Dr. Nader Al Nakouzi, Chris Wang, and Gunjan Kumar from the Vancouver Prostate Centre. We are part of the group that recently published a study detailing the use of a malaria protein, VAR2CSA, as a new and novel way of targeting cancers.


Cancer and the placenta show many similar characteristics. However, scientists have spent decades trying to find biochemical similarities between placenta tissue and cancer. Together with our colleagues from University of Copenhagen we discovered how malaria uses VAR2CSA to embed itself in the placenta and how the same target is present on cancer cells. Based on that discovery we immediately saw its potential to deliver cancer drugs in a precise, controlled way to tumors.


New and novel ways of targeting cancers are needed in order to combat the disease. With a recombinant version of VAR2CSA, we hope to develop a promising therapy for a broad spectrum of different cancers.

Basically it states that sleep is required to switch the brain from processing of data from external sensors (eyes, ears etc.) to internal ones, like receptors in intestines, and do the adjustments accordingly. In his works he shows that if one stimulates e.g. the intestine of a sleeping animal it causes the response in visual cortex which is very similar to the response to flickers of light during the day, whilst there is no such response in waking state. He states that they conducted hundreds of experiments on animals in support of the view.

This was completely new to me (which is to no surprise, I'm quite illiterate in neurophysiology) and I'm fascinated by the idea. The first thing I did is checked if his works are legit and if he has publications in respectable magazines, which he seem to have. He also doesn't look like a usual ""science freak"" which are plenty around here. However, I tried to google some popular articles in English about that but haven't found much.

So I want to know if this view is known to Western scientists and if yes what is the common opinion on that? Community's opinion on the matter would be also great to hear!

If not, he couldnt see them move normally, because he can observe them for 23 years, while they only ""do actions"" that take 3 hours.
